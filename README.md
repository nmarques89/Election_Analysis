## Election Audit Summary
This election data could have been better parsed with further qualifiers such as age, sex, and race. However, this is an issue for the base data and not necessarily with the script itself. As it is, the script could be modified to use conditionals to determine which candidates performed strongest with all the various demographic groups mentioned above.
